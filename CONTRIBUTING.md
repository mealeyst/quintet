# How to contribute

1. Fork the repo.

3. Make changes, add a feature, or fix a bug.

7. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on me. I like to at least comment on, if not
accept, pull requests within three business days (and, typically, one business
day). I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
